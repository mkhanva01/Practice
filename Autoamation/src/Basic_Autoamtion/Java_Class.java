		//~Java Execution
		//Javac is command that read source files that contain module, package and type declarations written in the JAVA programming language and compiled them into class files that run on the JVM (JAVA virtual machine)
		
		
		//JAVA Access Modifier-Public: Accessible from anywhere in the package and classes.
							//Protected: Accessible from the classes under same package and subclass
							//Default: Accessible by the classes of the same package
							//Private: Accessible only within same class
		
		
		//What is A class? A class is a collection of methods and data.
		//What is a Public class? Public means that the class can be accessed by any other class in any package.
		
		
		//**Public static void main(String[] args){}
		//main: Main is a method of the class, While running Java program we've to define main method
		//void: Void returns nothing. We want the method to go forward and no return is expected.
		//Static: Is the type of the method, means we're not expecting any difference inside the method. It is defined as a member of the class rather than a member of an instance of the class.
		//Public: Public means the method is accessible by any class in any package.
		
		
		//When we're invoking the class, What I'm saying is "Java Runtime, run the program defined by the public static void main method of Java_Class"
		
		
		
		//Java Data Types
		//**Primitive data type**//
		
		//byte- Integer-- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction. Example 10 -- 	Range -128 and 127 -- 	Size of 8 Bits
		//short-Integer-- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction. Example 10000--	 Range -32768 to 32767-- Size of 16 Bits
		//int- Integer- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction. Example --2,147,483,647 Range -2M to -2,147,483,646-- Size of 32 Bits
		//long- Integer- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction.. Ex:--9223372'036'854 Range  -9'223'372'036'854'775'808 to 9'223'372'036'854'775'807 -- Size of 64 Bits = 8 byte
		//float- fractional-Fractional consists of two numbers. (With decimal). Means a numerator and a denominator= Example 10.254756 -- Size of 32 Bits = 4 byte
		//double- fractional-Fractional consists of two numbers. (With decimal). Means a numerator and a denominator= Example 10.2547568985658214-- Size of 64 Bits = 8 byte
		//char- Char is used to store different type of data Example= A,b,c/ 1,2,3/ ?,!,# 	Size of 16 Bits
		//Boolean- denotes two type True/False  Size of 1 Bit
		
		
		//String- Sequence of character- Example "Myn ame 123 wha  t??"

		 What is a locator?
		 Locator is a type of command which helps to locate any web element from any web application.
		 Locators are used to automate web applications by finding elements and performing actions.
		 Type of Locators: ID, Name, Class, LinkText, PartialLinkText, Tagname, XPath, CSS
		 
		 
		 
		 ~~What is XPath: Xpath is XML Path which itself is a locator
		 ~~What is XML: Extensible Markup Language (type of file format)
		 **Types of XPath: Absolute Xpath
		 *				   Relative Xpath
		 *Absolute Xpath: Absolute XPath is the direct way to find an element. **Starts with /
		 *Relative XPath: Relative XPath locates element from anywhere in the middle of the DOM (Document Object Model) **Starts with //
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 ~Preceding: Any element that's coming before the other											(Bottom to Top)
		 ~Descendant: Ancestor of any element. Any element that has been descended from its ancestor. (Top to Bottom)
		*/
		
		
		
		//ImplicitlyWait: It waits for the specified amount of time before throwing any exception.
		//ExplicitWait:	  It waits for the specified amount of time ALSO waits till the condition is met before throwing any exception.
	
	
	
		/*TestNG: It is an automation framework. NG stands for Next Generation.
		 
 		What can TestNG do? 
 		Using TestNG helps to enhance the testing process and makes it more efficient.
 		~It allows users to get a proper report after testing, That way the user gets to know how many test cases passed/ failed/ skipped. Based on that, the user can fix and run those failed/ skipped test cases.
		~Annotations can be used in TestNG which are also very definitive. Annotations like
		@Test, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod
		
		@BeforeTest:It executes the code block before any other code blocks
		@Test: This works as test methods, and will be executed After @BeforeTest.
		@AfterTest: This works as the concluding method and only executes after every other method is being executed.
		 
		~TestNG allows users to create multiple methods (Multiple TestCases)
		
		
		~We can parameterize the methods like Priority, DependsOnMethods, Group, InvocationCount, ThreadPoolSize, enabled
		
		~Priority: Prioritize methods. 
		~InvocationCount: Invokes methods a number of times. (Performance testing)
		~ThreadPoolSize: Opens up new Threads/Window concurrently (Has to be used with invocationCount)
		~dependsOnMethods: Depends on specified method
		~groups: Grouping method. Ex: Smoke, Regression
		~enabled: True/ False to run or Skip a method.
		
		~We can Create a Test Suite using TestNG, Which means we can create a suit of test cases which holds multiple testcases and can be running at once.

		/*What is 'Keys'?
		 ~In order to press enter, control, tab, arrow keys, Fn keys we use Keys 'Enum' which is provided by Selenium Webdriver.
		
		 What is 'Enum'?
		 ~Enum in Java is a data type which contains a fixed set of values. According to JAVA naming conventions we should have all the constants in uppercase letters.
		 Keys: BACK_SPACE, DOWN, ALT
		 Season: SUMMER, WINTER, SPRING
		 Fields: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, EAST
		 Days: SATURDAY, THURSDAY
		 
		 
		 What is 'break'?
		 ~Break is a statement which terminates the loop immediately and the control moves to the next statement.
		
		 What is the fail() method?
		 ~fail() is a method to primarily call it to test a negative flow where the code being tested should raise an exception.

		/*What is Actions Class?
		 Actions class is an ability provided by selenium for handling Keyboard and Mouse events. Primarily mimicking Keyboard and Mouse actions.
		 
		 *What is an Action Class?
		 *Action is an interface which allows a single user interaction action to be executed.
		 
		 ~SeriesofActions: This is a set/container to hold all the actions to be performed together.
		 
		 **build(): is a method to create a chain of actions in the actions class.
		 **perform(): is a method to execute a chain of actions which are built using the actions build() method.
		 
		 
		 What is Keys.chrod()?
		 This is a method to press multiple keys simultaneously/at the same time.
		 
		 
		 
		 switchTo.frame(frameNo)- This method allows the user to switch to a frame using frame no.

		  What is POM (Page Object Model)
		  A: POM is a design pattern to create an object repository for web pages. For each web page in the application requires its own corresponding class POM.
		  
		  Advantage of POM:
		  It allows us to keep all the webelements in one place.
		  ~Reusability. It saves either calling the object or maintaining it.
		  ~It makes it easier to understand the objects, WebElements are written in plain English.
		  
		  
		  **What is Constructor in JAVA?
		  A: Java constructors or constructors in java is a term used to construct something in our script. This is a special method that is to initialize objects.
		  THe constructor is called when an object of a class is created. Everytime an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
		  
		  
		  **What is Instantiate?
		  A: Instantiate in Java means to call a constructor of a class which creates an instance or object of the type of that class.
		  Instantiation allocates initial memory for the object and also returns a reference.
		  
		  
		  Simple meaning of instantiate is creating an object from class.
		  Instantiate== create an instance== create an object of a class
		  ClassName obj = new Classname();
		  
		  
		  
		 ~What is 'this' Keyword?
		  A: This keyword can be used to invoke the current class constructor. It is used to reuse the constructor. In other words, it is used for constructor chaining.
		  Every object can access a reference to itself with the keyword this. (Sometimes called the 'this reference')
		  
		  
		  ~What is Object?
		  A: An instance of a class. In one class we can create many instances. 
		  
		  
		 ~What is Encapsulation?
		  
		  Encapsulation in Java is a JAVA mechanism of OOP concept (Object Oriented Programming) of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
		  In Encapsulation the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can only be accessed through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it's also known as Data Hiding.
		  
		  ~What is Inheritance?
		 
		 Inheritance is a JAVA mechanism of OOP concept (Object Oriented Programming) which allows/helps us to
		 create a new class from an existing class. Inheriting the class acquires all the properties of the parent object.

		 Git and GitHub/Gitlab
		 
		 ~What is Git?
		 : Git is a version control system that tracks any source code history/change. Which is being installed in 
		 local machine. Later on to make for collaboration we use repositories like Github.
		 
		 ~What is GitHub?
		 :Git is a Platform for code hosting for version control and collaboration between communities.
		 It also works as a source code repository.
		 
		 ~What is Source Code?
		 : In simple words, Source code is any collection of codes.
		 
		 ~What is Version Control?
		 :It's a system which records all the changes/updates made to a file or a set of files.
		 
		 if there's 1 source code and it's pushed to GitHub, all the team members working on the same file but they 
		 have their own version control, so if anyone on the team makes any changes that'll be visible on his version
		 control. So, all the member will know the status also will be able to work on the latest version of the file
